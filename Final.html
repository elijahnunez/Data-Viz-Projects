    <h1>Puerto Rico, Migration, Displacement, and Opportunities Sought Outside of the Island</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
        Puerto Rico, otherwise known as "the enchanted island," has been a commonwealth of the United States since the Spanish-American War, when Spain ceded Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam to the US. The commonwealth status prevents Puerto Rico from becoming a fully established state and keeps it under the supervision of the US. The US has tried to assimilate the island into regular American culture, but these attempts have not often been successful. In the recent decade, Puerto Rican culture and the island have gained a lot of attention, from stars like Bad Bunny becoming extremely popular, to unfortunate natural disasters like Hurricane Maria and the earthquakes that have had tremendous effects on the island, and new tax laws that encourage gentrification often only accessible to the uber-rich.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sets Used</h2>
    <p>The data sets used for this project were curated as much of the data collection had many points that were not needed. The data was gathered from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Centro’s data on Puerto Ricans in the United States on Tableau Public</li>
        <li>The Bureau of Labor Statistics for GDP, employment, and various income levels</li>
        <li>Puerto Rico’s portal informativo del ciudadano for disaster recovery</li>
        <li>The World Bank for Employment Rates in Puero Rico
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Economy and Poverty</h2>
    <p>
        Looking at the labor and economic statistics provided by the World Bank, we can begin to look at the trends in the opportunity for Puerto Ricans. Firstly, the average annual income is higher than the median average income. The wealth gap here shows many higher-income earners are earning more than the average person in Puerto Rico. Although, even with the higher-income earners skewing the average, the GDP per capita is still higher than both of these measures. When GDP is higher, it can be a sign that the nation’s economic output comes from other spending measures and the economic opportunity for its people is low.

    <h2>Labor & Participation</h2>
    <p>
        The economic opportunity in Puerto Rico for natives is not the highest. The embargos the US has imposed, such as the Jones Act, have left it unable to trade with many parts of the world and even prevent the island from receiving aid from other countries during Hurricane Maria. Acts 22/20 and 60 are supposed to encourage economic growth on the island by allowing those who live ½ time on the island to not have to pay federal taxes. But this is only afforded to people who are not citizens of Puerto Rico already. This encourages celebrities like Jake Paul, who famously moved to the island for this opportunity. This creates entrepreneurs and businesses that pay workers unfairly, and with Puerto Rico following different laws than those of the US, the output can be just that. The graph below shows the labor participation rate in Puerto Rico and the estimated population size in this time period.

    <h2>Disaster Relief Spending from 2018 - Beyond</h2>
    <p>
        Puerto Rico has been hit with natural disasters in the past few years that have caused many Puerto Ricans to flee the island. Below are some of the disaster relief budgets for those various events. Hurricane Maria had the most allocated to it, as it damaged much of the infrastructure, and after this, Hurricane Irma hit which led to more destruction and has two allocated budgets, then COVID-19 and earthquakes which damaged much of the south of Puerto Rico.

    <h2>Where are Puerto Ricans Going?</h2>
    <p>
        Using Centro's table on the migration of Puerto Ricans within the United States, we can look at the biggest enclaves of Puerto Ricans and the change in population size within the US. The top five states with the largest Puerto Rican populations are New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Massachusetts. The Northeast has been a significant destination for the diaspora, with the New York/Puerto Rican identity being shaped by movements such as the Nuyorican Movement and The Young Lords, which inform the diasporic Puerto Rican identity.

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        When working on this project, there are a lot of variables that one could examine to understand the displacement occurring on the island. These variables could also be replicated to determine if other regions are experiencing similar effects. With more time and knowledge about where data on Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans is available, one could develop a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to displacement. This includes analyzing economic indicators, migration patterns, employment rates, and the impact of natural disasters. By studying these measures, we can gain insights into the broader context of displacement and identify potential solutions to address the challenges faced by Puerto Ricans. Moreover, this approach could be applied to other regions to see if they exhibit similar trends, thereby contributing to a more global understanding of displacement and its driving factors.
